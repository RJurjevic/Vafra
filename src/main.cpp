/*
  V 14.12.0
    - Stockfish 12 modified so to use flipped HalfKP 256x2-32-32-1 NNUE.
    - Used nn-562d1cf56c39.nnue NNUE aka nn-v0f000010003.nnue.
    - Quiet moves sort scoring updated as in Stockfish 16 by adding bonuses for checks and escaping from capture and malus for putting piece en prise.
    - In search Step 7 Razoring razoring implemented similarly as in Stockfish 16.
    - In search Step 11 Internal iterative deepening internal iterative deepening implemented similarly as in Stockfish 9 instead of if the position is not in TT decreasing the depth by 2.
    - In search Step 16 Reduced depth removed decreasing reduction if the ttHit running average is large.

  V 14.12.1
    - Used nn-622d6e793eaf.nnue NNUE aka nn-v0f000010909.nnue.
    - In search Step 16 Reduced depth search removed ttHit running average from do LMR criteria.

  V 14.12.2
    - Used nn-5fb643a11020.nnue NNUE aka nn-v0f000011110.nnue.
    - In search Step 16 Reduced depth search LMR is not applied if the move is extended.
    - In search Step 11 Internal iterative deepening now calculates ttValue.
    - In Eval::evaluate updated hybrid evaluation similarly as in Stockfish 16.
